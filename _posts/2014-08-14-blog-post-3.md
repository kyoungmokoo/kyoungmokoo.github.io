<b>Seoul, Korea</b><br><i>Sep 2020 - June 2021</i>

As a dedicated member of the student-run club, Growth Hackers, at Seoul National University, I had the rewarding opportunity to mentor and educate over 20 selected underclassmen fellows throughout an academic year. My role was to demystify the fundamentals of Python programming and data analysis, equipping these bright minds with the tools to navigate the vast landscape of technology and innovation.

Beyond teaching, I played a pivotal role in amplifying our club's presence. By strategically utilizing platforms like YouTube and LinkedIn, I spearheaded our efforts to market Growth Hackers to external organizations. These initiatives not only showcased the talent within our club but also opened avenues for collaboration, networking, and growth that went far beyond the university's campus. It was an enriching experience that highlighted the importance of knowledge sharing and community outreach in today's interconnected world.
