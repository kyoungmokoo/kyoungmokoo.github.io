<em>Seoul, Korea</em>
<i>Mar 2020 - June 2020</i>

 I am proud to reflect on a formative experience during my time at Seoul National University, where I was part of the dynamic Student Venture group. Our collaboration was the epitome of teamwork and intellectual exchange, consisting of over 20 passionate members. Together, we dissected and presented in-depth analyses of startup business models at our weekly meetings, fostering a vibrant atmosphere of learning and innovation.

I had the honor of leading a pivotal initiative that further enriched our entrepreneurial ecosystem: orchestrating a partnership project with Prop Tech Forum Korea. This ambitious project culminated in a university-wide hackathon, designed to ignite the creative sparks of our student community and bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world problem-solving. It was a testament to the power of collaboration and the shared spirit of enterprise that thrives within the walls of SNU.
