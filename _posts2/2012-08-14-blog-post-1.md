<b>Stanford, California</b><br><i>June 2018 - July 2018</i>

 I was chosen from a pool of over 100 talented applicants by the Seoul National University (SNU) Office of International Affairs to engage in a two-month entrepreneurial fellowship program. This opportunity allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant world of innovation and entrepreneurship.

During this fellowship, I had the privilege of presenting a business model that I developed, which leverages deep-learning for automated advertisement design, to esteemed professors at Stanford University. This model represents the synergy of cutting-edge artificial intelligence with creative marketing strategies to revolutionize how we approach ad design in the digital era.
