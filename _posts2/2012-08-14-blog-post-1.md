I developed a robot-assisted ultrasound system (RAUS) as an extension of my previous research in robotics and optics under the guidance of Professors Mark Draelos and Xueding Wang. This system integrated a UR3 (Universal Robot 3) robotic arm with a GE ultrasound device to autonomously scan a patient’s hand, aiming to detect potential signs of arthritis. I created the firmware for controlling the robot and streaming images from the ultrasound device, utilizing Python, C++, and their associated libraries for simulations and experimental setups. Moreover, I applied inverse kinematics to determine robotic joint angles at each waypoint and employed forward kinematics for 3D ultrasound image reconstruction using MATLAB and Python-based computer vision tools. After building the RAUS prototype, I concentrated on calibrating the alignment between the robotic arm’s end effector and the ultrasound probe, a critical step for accurately producing 3D images from multiple B-scans.
