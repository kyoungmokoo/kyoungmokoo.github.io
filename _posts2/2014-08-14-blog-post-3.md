  Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) thruster has relative advantages compared to the traditional motor attached to a ship. Since the thruster has no moving parts, it is free of problems regarding cavitation and noise. It is propelled by Lorentz force, generated by the magnetic field of magnets and electric current between electrodes.

  Our research presents the results of the feasibility study, manufacturing, and experiments of a no-insulation (NI) high-temperature superconductor (HTS) applied magnetohydrodynamic ship. The stability of NI HTS allows magnets to flow current up to critical value, which is the maximum current for the superconductor to maintain superconductivity, enabling the ship to be propelled by maximum momentum. Open-ceiling which acts as an entrance of LN2 during the experiment and serial connection of the battery and superconducting magnets are the original design of our team, devised for moving the worldâ€™s first NI HTS applied MHD ship.
