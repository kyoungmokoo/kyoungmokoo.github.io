<b>Ann Arbor, Michigan</b><br><i>Aug 2023 - Oct 2023</i>

As an active member of the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicle team, a student-led organization at the forefront of autonomous aerial vehicle design and manufacturing, I immersed myself in the innovative world of drone technology. Our collective efforts and passion for engineering were put on display at the prestigious International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC), where we showcased our technical achievements.

My personal contribution to the team centered around designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) that integrate microprocessors and sensors. Utilizing tools such as Altium for PCB design and the STM32 Cube IDE for development, I honed my skills in creating sophisticated circuits tailored for drone applications.

This experience also allowed me to delve deeply into the world of microprocessors, gaining substantial knowledge of pin functionalities and developing a proficiency in various communication protocols essential for drone circuitry. This technical acumen was not only instrumental for our projects but also a significant addition to my professional expertise in the realm of autonomous vehicles.
