As the leader of an official student-run organization at the University of Michigan, I managed a team of 10 board members to create networking opportunities that helped new students integrate into the university community. Our primary focus was to assist over 150 incoming students, particularly Korean graduate students, post-docs, and visiting scholars, in adjusting to their new environment. We organized events that fostered meaningful social interactions and provided a support system for these students during their transition. By promoting engagement among peers, we helped cultivate a sense of belonging and community within the university. 

Additionally, I spearheaded the organization of career development events, building connections between Korean tech companies and Korean graduate students at the University of Michigan. These events aimed to bridge the gap between academia and industry, offering students insights into career opportunities and potential pathways in the tech field. This effort not only enhanced the professional prospects of the students but also strengthened ties between the university and international tech industries. Overall, my role involved leadership, event management, and facilitating professional growth for the students, contributing to both their social and career development.
