During my internship at Diveroid, a dynamic startup nestled in Seoul, Korea, I had the privilege of delving into the exciting world of underwater photography equipment. Through strategic marketing initiatives, I managed to deploy a substantial budget exceeding $20K across social media platforms, reaching diving enthusiasts in over 50 countries and amplifying our brand's global presence. My role extended beyond traditional marketing as I delved into data analysis, meticulously dissecting the performance of our social media ads. By identifying patterns and optimizing our strategies, we ensured that every click counted, driving engagement and fostering a vibrant online community. One of the most rewarding moments of my journey was orchestrating a Kickstarter campaign that secured over $200K in capital. This achievement underscored the effectiveness of our data-driven growth marketing approach and solidified Diveroid's position as an industry leader.
