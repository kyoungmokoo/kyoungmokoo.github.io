During my enriching internship at SNEK, a forward-thinking economy media startup nestled in the heart of Seoul, Korea, I had the privilege of spearheading impactful initiatives that propelled our platform to new heights. One of my key achievements was optimizing our paying user conversion rate by delving deep into the spending patterns of monthly premium users, utilizing Python for insightful data analysis. To further drive user engagement and platform growth, I proposed and executed targeted Google advertisements aimed at interested potential customers and inactive users, strategically directing user traffic and expanding our reach. Through collaborative efforts and strategic initiatives, I'm proud to have contributed to a milestone achievement of surpassing 160K total users and maintaining over 100K monthly active users on our platform.
