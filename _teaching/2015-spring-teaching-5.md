At BorgWarner, a global leader in innovative mobility solutions for the automotive industry, I served as an eHardware Architect Intern. During my tenure, I developed user interfaces utilizing a keypad and OLED display connected to an FPGA board via the SPI bus. This involved not only the design and implementation of the user interfaces but also ensuring seamless communication and functionality through the integration of various functional blocks on the FPGA board. I enabled digital signal processing using Verilog/VHDL in the Vivado environment, which required a deep understanding of both hardware and software design principles. Additionally, I participated in designing a circuit prototype and PCB board to optimize signal performance for users. This project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in hardware design, from schematic creation to layout considerations, and involved collaborating with team members to ensure the design met all necessary specifications and performance criteria. Overall, my time at BorgWarner allowed me to apply and expand my technical skills in digital signal processing and hardware architecture, contributing to the advancement of cutting-edge automotive technologies and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the development process within a leading global company.
