During my internship at Nrise, an innovative startup nestled in the vibrant landscape of Seoul, Korea, I immersed myself in the world of social dating applications, particularly our flagship product, Wippy. My journey was marked by impactful contributions, including the optimization of push message notifications. Through meticulous user segmentation and personalized messaging strategies, we enhanced user engagement and fostered meaningful connections. Utilizing my analytical skills, I delved into user behavior, analyzing click-rates and identifying effective buzzwords to tailor our notifications for maximum impact. By leveraging SQL and Python, we unlocked valuable insights, shaping our communication strategies with precision and foresight. Moreover, I had the privilege of leading a dynamic team of 10+ project members, facilitating seamless communication between the project team and the management. Together, we navigated challenges, celebrated successes, and drove innovation forward, cementing Nrise's position as a frontrunner in the social dating sphere.
