Welcome! I'm Kyoungmo Koo, a Masterâ€™s student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) specializing in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/). My academic focus spans optics, medical robotics, embedded systems, and control systems. I began my journey at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), where I earned my undergraduate degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en). Currently, I am a lab intern at the [Image-Guided Medical Robotics Lab](https://medical.robotics.umich.edu/), under the guidance of Professor Mark Draelos. My work here involves two exciting projects. The first is developing a digital interface for controlling galvanometers to enhance the performance of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) systems, particularly in improving cost-efficiency and resolution. The second project focuses on creating a medical robotic system that uses ultrasound and photoacoustic techniques to scan hands for arthritis detection. This past summer, I completed an internship as an Electrical Engineering Intern with the eHardware Architecture team at [BorgWarner](https://www.borgwarner.com/home), gaining valuable industry experience. Prior to that, I explored the realm of superconductivity as an intern at the [Applied Superconductivity Lab](http://asl.snu.ac.kr/), led by Professor Seungyong Hahn. I firmly believe that innovations in optics and embedded systems will play a key role in shaping a more brighter future for all communities.
