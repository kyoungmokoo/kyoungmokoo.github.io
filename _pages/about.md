Hi, my name is Kyoungmo Koo. I am currently delving into the intricacies of embedded systems and power electronics as a Master's student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), specializing in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/). My academic journey began at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), where I earned my undergraduate degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en).

Presently, I'm applying my expertise as a lab intern at the [Image-Guided Medical Robotics lab](https://medical.robotics.umich.edu/) under the guidance of Professor Mark Draelos. Previously, I've honed my skills in the realm of superconductivity as an intern at the [Applied Superconductivity Lab](http://asl.snu.ac.kr/), led by Professor Seungyong Hahn.
My passion lies at the intersection of embedded systems, digital communication, power electronics, and robotics. My current project is focused on crafting a digital interface for a Scannermax galvanometer controller, a pivotal component in Robotically Aligned Optical Coherence Tomography (RAOCT). This endeavor encompasses a spectrum of communication protocols, including the Serial Audio Interface (SAI), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) standard.

During my undergraduate tenure, I embarked on research projects in cutting-edge areas such as no-insulation superconductors for power plants, wave energy converters (WEC), and ion propulsion motors.
Driven by the ambition to enhance global living standards, my ultimate objective is to innovate in the creation of electrical devices that are not only efficient but also conserve time and energy. I'm convinced that advancements in embedded systems and power electronics will be pivotal in shaping the future, making everyday life more sustainable and convenient for communities worldwide.

Developing a digital interface to a ScannerMAX galvanometer controller
======
In a groundbreaking endeavor, I have architected a sophisticated digital interface for a Scannermax galvanometer controller, which serves as a fundamental element in Robotically Aligned Optical Coherence Tomography (RAOCT). This interface is bolstered by the achievement of stable bidirectional communication at a 48 kHz frame frequency, adeptly handling uint32 position data via Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Serial Audio Interface (SAI), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART).

The project's complexity was addressed by employing a Future Technology Devices International (FTDI) cable, which was instrumental in converting UART-to-USB and SPI-to-USB. A cornerstone of this project's success was the rigorous calculation and integration of the communication protocols' delays, ensuring that the timing diagram of the embedded system was accurate for each channel. This meticulous attention to detail was crucial for the synchronization and performance of the system. Moreover, the deployment of Direct Memory Access (DMA) facilitated the independent operations of different channels, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the system and reducing the workload on the CPU. The system's agility and smooth operation were further augmented by a series of callback functions, which were strategically sequenced to ensure fluid transitions between communication channels.

This digital interface is not merely a technical accomplishment but a significant advancement in the RAOCT domain, promising to enhance the precision and efficiency of robotically aligned procedures and imaging techniques.


Analysis and Experimental Study of LN2 Cooled No-insulation High-Temperature Superconductor Applied Preliminary Magnetohydrodynamic Ship
======
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) thruster has relative advantages compared to the traditional motor attached to a ship. Since the thruster has no moving parts, it is free of problems regarding cavitation and noise. It is propelled by Lorentz force, generated by the magnetic field of magnets and electric current between electrodes.

Our research presents the results of the feasibility study, manufacturing, and experiments of a no-insulation (NI) high-temperature superconductor (HTS) applied magnetohydrodynamic ship. The stability of NI HTS allows magnets to flow current up to critical value, which is the maximum current for the superconductor to maintain superconductivity, enabling the ship to be propelled by maximum momentum. Open-ceiling which acts as an entrance of LN2 during the experiment and serial connection of the battery and superconducting magnets are the original design of our team, devised for moving the world's first NI HTS applied MHD ship.

Conceptual Design and Analysis of No-Insulation High- Temperature Superconductor Tubular Wave Energy Converter
======
Wave energy is one of the most affluent renewable energy resources in the world and total energy worldwide has been increasing annually from 1948 to 2008. (1. B. G. Reguero et al., 2019) 
We proposed the conceptual design of a no-insulation (NI) HTS tubular wave energy converter (WEC) through sweeping magnet parameters and measuring output power. Thanks to the volume efficiency and high magnetic field generated by NI technology, the large output power can be achieved through the small size of WEC. 

The design is analyzed in the aspect of electromagnetism, mechanical force, and cryogen. Output power is measured by rectifying the circuit of the generator. Total harmonic distortion and power factor are also calculated for various conditions.

100MW class large-scale green hydrogen production plant construction project through high-temperature superconducting magnet-based large-capacity wave power generation
------
Hydrogen is considered to be one of the most important energy carriers, due to its high volume efficiency when it comes to storing energy. Since low-temperature that is close to 20 K is needed to maintain liquid hydrogen (LH2), YBCO superconductor can enter the state of allowing high current to flow without any resistance.

We proposed the possibility of energy flow, starting from wave energy converter, passing through water electrolyzer, liquefaction facility, and arriving at fueling station. Superconductivity is applied to the whole process, and the design of 2 MW high temperature superconductor (HTS) wave energy converter (WEC) plays a key role in the system.
